# Book-Cipher
A C++ program that creates an encoded message using coordinates from a book

To use this program: 
The command line interface for the encoder is as follows : bcencode.exe bookfile.txt messagefile.txt outputfile.txt
The command line interface for the decoder is as follows : bcdecode.exe bookfile.txt codedfile.txt outputfile.txt

Create the following txt files for the encoding process: 
    -A message file containing the message you want encoded
    -A book file containing the text that will be used to encode the message
    -A result file will be written containing the encoded message.
For the decoding process use the following:
    -The coded file should be the file that was created by the encoding process
    -The book file should be the same as the file used to encode the message
    -A result file will be written containing the decoded message
